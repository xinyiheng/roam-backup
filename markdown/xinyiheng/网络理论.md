- 为什么堵住了主干道交通却更好了？
    - It gets even trickier. On Earth Day in 1990, New York City's Transportation Commissioner decided to close 42nd Street, a major road connecting Grand Central Train Station and Times Square. "Many predicted it would be doomsday," Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio told the New York Times. But surprisingly, not only did closing the street not result in bad traffic, it actually improved it. New York City drivers would usually flock to 42nd street, the widest street around, slowing traffic for everybody while the smaller streets around it remained largely empty. By taking the 42nd street option off the table, the flow of traffic actually improved. This surprising result could be attributed to what network theory calls Braess's Paradox. It states that adding edges to a network will not necessarily result in a better flow and may sometimes even lead to congestion.Via[If everything is a network, nothing is a network](https://visualisingadvocacy.org/node/739.html) [[20210115]] 下午8:28

    - In 1964, RAND scientist Paul Baran drew this famous diagram that shows 3 possible network topologies and their levels of vulnerability in case of a nuclear attack. The distributed network was chosen for the military communication networks that set the foundation for the TCP/IP protocol which is at the core of the internet we use today. Though most of our online interactions today take place over proprietary centralised networks and infrastructure, the myth of the internet’s birth and the popularity of social networking platforms have captured our imagination and informed our conception of society and power relations in terms of a distributed network. More recently, advanced research into biotechnology, neuroscience and machine learning have popularised experimental research into neural networks such as the cutting-edge of artificial intelligence and science fiction-like post-humanistic visions.Via[If everything is a network, nothing is a network](https://visualisingadvocacy.org/node/739.html) [[20210115]] 下午8:31
- 计算机不需要可视化，人类才需要。因此，可视化本质需要帮助人更容易理解。
- 网络的形状有时候不如网络上的流量重要。
    - 这或许可以解释为什么主干道封闭之后，道路反而更畅通了。
- 网络需要人的阐述解释。
- 为什么人们线性阅读反而比网状的思考感觉收获更多？
- 时间怎样作为一个维度协调网络不同部分之间的协作？例如github的软件版本控制。
