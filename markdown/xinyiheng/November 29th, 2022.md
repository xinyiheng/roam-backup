- Coates shares these reflections in a captivating book, The Hour Between Dog and Wolf, which draws on his years as a trader as well as on his surprising second career as an applied physiologist. Over time, the questions generated by his work in finance—“Could we tell whether one person has better gut feelings than another? Could we monitor feedback from their bodies?”—became more compelling than the work itself, and Coates left Wall Street to pursue the answers in scientific research. He presented the fruits of his inquiry in 2016, detailing the results of a collaboration with academic neuroscientists and psychiatrists in the journal Scientific Reports.

- Further, he observes, “some people may be better at this than others.” On any Wall Street trading floor “you will find high-IQ, Ivy League–educated stars who cannot make any money at all, for all their convincing analyses; while across the aisle sits a trader with an undistinguished degree from an unknown university, who cannot keep up with the latest analytics, but who consistently prints money, to the bafflement and irritation of his seemingly more gifted colleagues.” It is possible, muses Coates, “though odd to contemplate, that the better judgment of the money-making trader may owe something to his or her ability to produce bodily signals, and equally to listen to them.”

- Then there were other occasions, equally puzzling. “I would catch a glimpse with peripheral vision of another possibility, another path into the future. It showed up as a mere blip in my consciousness, a momentary tug on my attention, but it was a flash of insight coupled with a gut feeling that gave it the imprimatur of the highly probable.” When he obeyed these “gut feelings,” Coates found, he was usually rewarded with a profitable outcome. Against all his assumptions, all his training, Coates was forced to arrive at an unconventional conclusion: “Good judgment may require the ability to listen carefully to feedback from the body.”
