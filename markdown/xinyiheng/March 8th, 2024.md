* THE POWER OF INSTINCT

* 博达发过这本书的信息，我自己错过了。

* Sasha Tao

* 很少和这个人联系。这家出版公司其实主要做的书和我们的选题方向也不契合。

* TELLTALE HEARTS

* 有待查清楚授权渠道，我没收到邮件。这本书预计2024年7月出版。中信知道信息时间并不算太早。我们和public affairs合作很少，可以主动搜索新书，然后询问博达。貌似该公司的书的信息最早可以在amazon上搜到。

*     * 新书中信签了 讲线性代数的BIG MATHHow Linear Algebra Found Its Mojo and Sparked the Data Revolution(Working Title)By Steven Strogatz, Alex Townsend[US — Little, Brown, UK — John Murray, WORLD SPANISH — Ediciones Paidos, CHINA — CITIC,GREECE — Katoptro; Proposal; Delivery: August 2025; 80,000 words]Award-winning mathematicians and professors Steven Strogatz and Alex Townsend from Cornell Universitypresent a playful, wide-ranging, and profoundly human account of linear algebra, the fastest-growing mathsubject in the world."Imagine every photo on your phone, every movie you stream, and every secure credit card transaction youmake online," the authors write. "Big Math (i.e., linear algebra) is operating under the hood for each of theseeveryday miracles. It is:• The mathematical machinery that compresses images so they can be quickly uploaded to Instagram.• The secret sauce behind Netflix to recommend your next favorite show.• The sentinel that encrypts your data to keep it safe from prying eyes.• The force behind Google's search algorithm allowing you to sift through the vastness of the internetwith a few keystrokes.• The brainpower enabling the AI revolution, from self-driving cars to large language models likeChatGPT."Big Math provides the concepts and algorithms needed in today's digital world. Yet Big Math isn't limited topractical applications. It promotes a broader, multi-dimensional thinking style critical for solving problems in allwalks of life. It teaches us to see and manipulate relationships in a cloud of numbers, understand structures andpatterns, and simplify complex problems into manageable pieces. This skill set is invaluable for scientists,engineers, programmers, entrepreneurs, financial quants, and anyone who deals with the colossal amounts ofdata that define our information-saturated age."Big Math is the first book to introduce linear algebra to a non-technical audience—exploring what it is, whocreated it, and why it matters."Brockman, Inc.

*     * 新书也被中信买了ADAPTABLEHow Our Clever Bodies ThriveBy Herman Pontzer[US — Avery, UK — Allen Lane, JAPAN — Soshisha, CHINA — CITIC; Draft Manuscript; Pub Date: Spring2025; 100,000 words]Evolutionary anthropologist Herman Pontzer provides a new understanding of how our bodies work, how tokeep them healthy, and how our biological diversity unites us rather than divides us.How does the body work—and why does it seem to work so differently for each of us? Why do we grow tall orshort, obese or slim? Why do some of us stay healthy despite our bad habits while others who do all the rightthings fall ill? When we look around the planet, why do people vary in skin color, facial features, stature, bodyproportions, and disease risk?The answer is both simple and powerful: we're different because we're adaptable. Over the past 100,000 years,as humans expanded into every biome on the planet, our bodies were fine-tuned to our local environments.Adaptability is at the heart of being human and the engine of our diversity. Variation isn't a bug, it's a feature.Working with human populations around the globe, Pontzer's research embraces our incredible diversity,documenting the connections between lifestyle, landscape, local adaptations, and health.Adaptable takes us on a tour of human body. In each chapter, we learn how our bodies navigate an uncertainworld: how we grow and mature, how our brains develop and learn, how our hearts, lungs, and digestivesystems deliver oxygen and nutrients, how we manage toxins, temperature, and water balance, how we moveand reproduce, how our immune system keeps invaders at bay, and how we age and decline. Along the way, welearn how to keep our remarkable bodies healthy, and that the universe of healthy lifestyles is vast (we don'tneed the latest fad diet or cleanse!) We also learn how our bodies evolved to thrive in nearly any habitat onearth, from sea to mountains, ice caps to deserts, and how our adaptability enabled our species' globalexpansion.Brockman, Inc.
