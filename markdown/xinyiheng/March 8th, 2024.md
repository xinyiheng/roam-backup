        - 有待查清楚授权渠道，我没收到邮件。这本书预计2024年7月出版。中信知道信息时间并不算太早。我们和public affairs合作很少，可以主动搜索新书，然后询问博达。貌似该公司的书的信息最早可以在amazon上搜到。

How Linear Algebra Found Its Mojo and Sparked the Data Revolution) is operating under the hood for each of theseeveryday miracles. It is:• The mathematical machinery that compresses images so they can be quickly uploaded to Instagram.• The secret sauce behind Netflix to recommend your next favorite show.• The sentinel that encrypts your data to keep it safe from prying eyes.• The force behind Google's search algorithm allowing you to sift through the vastness of the internetwith a few keystrokes.• The brainpower enabling the AI revolution, from self-driving cars to large language models likeChatGPT."Big Math provides the concepts and algorithms needed in today's digital world. Yet Big Math isn't limited topractical applications. It promotes a broader, multi-dimensional thinking style critical for solving problems in allwalks of life. It teaches us to see and manipulate relationships in a cloud of numbers, understand structures andpatterns, and simplify complex problems into manageable pieces. This skill set is invaluable for scientists,engineers, programmers, entrepreneurs, financial quants, and anyone who deals with the colossal amounts ofdata that define our information-saturated age."Big Math is the first book to introduce linear algebra to a non-technical audience—exploring what it is, whocreated it, and why it matters."Brockman, Inc.
