- The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it.  Quora’s mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.😀😀Via[Quora | AngelList Talent](https://angel.co/company/quora) [[20210117]] 上午7:07
