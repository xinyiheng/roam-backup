Retaining drivers was
an existential issue, so if tipping helped do this, it was worth it—even if
some customers would miss the good ‘ole non-tipping days. Plus, we figured that
the prospect of tips would motivate drivers to deliver an even higher level of
service, and when have customers ever complained about great service?]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/405CA2F0-D666-470C-9C08-250179660FA7)

At first, drivers were
grateful. But their gratitude soon gave way to disappointment, as it turned out
that while their total take per ride went up thanks to tipping, their overall
wages didn’t. Why? When we crunched the data, we discovered that by instituting
tipping on the platform we had created a problematic spillover: so many new
drivers signed up with Uber after we implemented tipping that there were fewer
rides—and thus fewer fares—to go around. On top of this, judging from customer
ratings of drivers, tipping didn’t lead to higher quality service as we had
anticipated. We weren’t sure exactly why this was the case, but it did fly in
the face of years of hospitality management research. In other words, the
advent of tipping incentivized more drivers to put in hours on the Uber
platform, but it didn’t sufficiently incentivize them to up their game on
customer service. But these surprises seemed insignificant compared to the big
surprise that came next. When we looked at the data on how often passengers
tipped—or didn’t tip—we found that only one percent of Uber passengers tipped
on every trip they took.67That’s right, only one in every hundred people was
sure to tip their driver! Meanwhile, 60 percent of people never tipped, and 39
percent sometimes did.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/3A142AF3-5956-4011-95F4-BCFC40F62470)

If you’ve spent any time around entrepreneurs, you’re probably
aware that “scale” has become a bit of a buzzword in the business world, where
it typically refers to the process of growing a company. But scaling isn’t just
the domain of scrappy startups. It isn’t simply about accumulating more users
or capturing more market share. Defined more broadly, “to scale” is to achieve
a desired outcome when you take an idea from a small group—of customers,
students, or citizens, for example—to a much larger one.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/B0B9A5F9-77DA-42D5-BD31-0EE205539733)

Too often, policymaking is conducted in an information
vacuum. A policy is proposed, voted on, and signed into law (or not), with
little consideration given to the impact that policy will have—relative to the
costs—when it is scaled up in the real world. Unfortunately, such oversights
can come with grave real-world consequences, ranging from unequal outcomes
whereby some populations reap more benefits of the policy than others, to
massive cost overruns and budget shortfalls for which lawmakers must compensate
by cutting other vital programs and services.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/70A752B2-7775-490F-9C78-D85562B8789C)

This book is broken into two parts. The first half will
teach you that scaling is a fragile concept. It unpacks the BIG5, or the five
key signature elements that will cause voltage drops and prevent an idea from
taking off. The first is identifying false positives—these are cases where
there was never any voltage in the first place, though it appeared otherwise.
The second cause is overestimating how big of a slice of the pie your idea can
capture. Often, this is the result of failing to know your audience—or assuming
that the small subset of people who have bought into your idea are more
representative of the general population than they actually are, so that when
you expand your idea it falls short for a broader set of people. The third
cause is failing to evaluate whether your initial success depends on unscalable
ingredients—unique circumstances that can’t be replicated at scale. The fourth
cause is when the implementation of your idea has unintended consequences, or
spillovers, that backfire against that same idea. And 18 the fifth is the
“supply-side economics” of scaling—for instance, will your idea be too costly
to sustain at scale? After you clear these BIG5 hurdles, you will know you have
an idea that scales.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/E4AD7DAA-780D-428D-8B71-0C0E184E3D96)

The second part of the book is about how to produce voltage
gains by adopting the practices necessary for maximum-impact scaling. It will
unpack four proven techniques for increasing positive results at scale: using
behavioral-economic incentives, such as the loss aversion principle, to create
rapid gains; exploiting easily missed opportunities on the margins of your
operation; knowing when to quit in the short-term in order to win in the
long-term; and designing a high-voltage culture that is sustainable at scale.]( )[ >>](marginnote3app://note/D9E2B90C-4207-48F0-8FE3-DA2F457BC712)

Justice’s 1985 assessment involving 1,777 children in Honolulu, Hawaii found
evidence “favoring the program’s preventative potential,”10and a subsequent
study conducted soon after in Los Angeles among nearly as many students also
concluded that D.A.R.E. led to a reduction in drug experimentation.11These 24
purportedly strong results drove schools, police departments, and the federal
government to just say yes to expanding D.A.R.E. nationwide, yet numerous
scientific analyses over the following decade examining all of the known
studies and data on the program yielded incontrovertible proof that D.A.R.E.
didn’t actually have a meaningful impact. So what happened? The simple answer
is this: It is not uncommon for data to “lie.” In the Honolulu study, for
example, the researchers had calculated that there was a two percent chance
their data would yield a false positive. Unfortunately, subsequent research
shows that they underestimated that probability. There was never any voltage in

            - For businesses, false
positives are usually easier to detect than in the world of medicine, simply by
testing a product or feature out on a sample set of customers. For instance,
when Lyft wants to test a new feature, they simply build it into the app and
make it available to users, usually in just two or three markets to start. This
gives my team ample data to analyze and determine if the new feature is worth
scaling or not.

The British psychologist Peter Wason’s classic Rule
Discovery Test from the 1960s illustrates confirmation bias in action. He gave
subjects three numbers and asked them to come up with the rule that applied to
the selection of those numbers. Given the sequence of “2–4—6,”for example, they
typically formed a hypothesis that the rule was even numbers. Then, the
participants would present other sequences of even numbers, and researchers
would tell them whether or not those numbers conformed to the rule. Through
this process, participants were tasked with determining whether their
hypothesis was correct. After several correct tries the 30 participants
believed that they had discovered the rule. But in fact, they hadn’t, because
the rule was much simpler: increasing numbers.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/8E751AAB-5A49-4D04-A098-139D7C554D4E)

The point here is that when bad ideas are endorsed by
influential people and institutions, they can be contagious. And once a
critical mass has climbed aboard that bandwagon, confirmation bias makes it
much harder to convince people to change their now entrenched 33 beliefs. This
is why it took many years, and many misspent millions, for D.A.R.E, to abandon
its flawed approach.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/CA540E04-8597-477B-8E40-314A70F68FF6)

In order to replicate effectively you must conduct the same
successful study/program/product test again with the same type of population,
and ideally you must do so three or four times before you can be confident you
have the truth. In some cases this might not be feasible, but my overarching
point is that in those instances you should tread with caution rather than
“move fast and break things.” Otherwise you will soon be broke yourself.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/06454333-AD68-409C-BE11-A2BA103DC648)

In science, the practice of replication has become a
hot-button issue, leading to what the media outlets are fond of calling the
“replication crisis.” Since the 2010s, researchers have set out to replicate
several high-profile experiments—especially in psychology—that made splashes in
major newspapers and on television, and found that the results failed to
replicate.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/E8474A85-501E-4E2C-A4CD-161613ACB7D0)

Holmes was smart and charismatic, allowing her to win over
investors, who then vouched for her to other investors, leading to a bandwagon
effect. Moreover, thanks to confirmation bias, investors with a financial stake
in the company likely overlooked signs that ran counter to their expectation
that the company would be a massive success. And these weren’t people born
yesterday. They included business titans like Rupert Murdoch, Carlos Slim,

        - A pharmaceutical company develops a promising new sleep medication in its lab, but the drug doesn’t live up to its promise in randomized trials. A small company in the Pacific Northwest successfully launches a product then expands to the Eastern Seaboard, only to find that it sells poorly on the East Coast. A venture capital firm invests millions in a new food delivery app, which ends up only capturing the eyeballs and clicks of a small slice of society.
        - Scalability isn’t just critical for policy and science but for anyone who stands to benefit from the success of an idea. All too often, promising ideas collapse at scale.
