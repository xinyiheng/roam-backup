          Retaining drivers was
          an existential issue, so if tipping helped do this, it was worth it—even if
          some customers would miss the good ‘ole non-tipping days. Plus, we figured that
          the prospect of tips would motivate drivers to deliver an even higher level of
          service, and when have customers ever complained about great service?]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/405CA2F0-D666-470C-9C08-250179660FA7)

          At first, drivers were
          grateful. But their gratitude soon gave way to disappointment, as it turned out
          that while their total take per ride went up thanks to tipping, their overall
          wages didn’t. Why? When we crunched the data, we discovered that by instituting
          tipping on the platform we had created a problematic spillover: so many new
          drivers signed up with Uber after we implemented tipping that there were fewer
          rides—and thus fewer fares—to go around. On top of this, judging from customer
          ratings of drivers, tipping didn’t lead to higher quality service as we had
          anticipated. We weren’t sure exactly why this was the case, but it did fly in
          the face of years of hospitality management research. In other words, the
          advent of tipping incentivized more drivers to put in hours on the Uber
          platform, but it didn’t sufficiently incentivize them to up their game on
          customer service. But these surprises seemed insignificant compared to the big
          surprise that came next. When we looked at the data on how often passengers
          tipped—or didn’t tip—we found that only one percent of Uber passengers tipped
          on every trip they took.67That’s right, only one in every hundred people was
          sure to tip their driver! Meanwhile, 60 percent of people never tipped, and 39
          percent sometimes did.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/3A142AF3-5956-4011-95F4-BCFC40F62470)

          If you’ve spent any time around entrepreneurs, you’re probably
          aware that “scale” has become a bit of a buzzword in the business world, where
          it typically refers to the process of growing a company. But scaling isn’t just
          the domain of scrappy startups. It isn’t simply about accumulating more users
          or capturing more market share. Defined more broadly, “to scale” is to achieve
          a desired outcome when you take an idea from a small group—of customers,
          students, or citizens, for example—to a much larger one.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/B0B9A5F9-77DA-42D5-BD31-0EE205539733)

          the customers’ residences, which side of the car men and women sit in the
          backseat, and the friendship networks among riders. I wondered what secrets

        - ## [ V.     
          This book is broken into two parts. The first half will
          teach you that scaling is a fragile concept. It unpacks the BIG5, or the five
          key signature elements that will cause voltage drops and prevent an idea from
          taking off. The first is identifying false positives—these are cases where
          there was never any voltage in the first place, though it appeared otherwise.
          The second cause is overestimating how big of a slice of the pie your idea can
          capture. Often, this is the result of failing to know your audience—or assuming
          that the small subset of people who have bought into your idea are more
          representative of the general population than they actually are, so that when
          you expand your idea it falls short for a broader set of people. The third
          cause is failing to evaluate whether your initial success depends on unscalable
          ingredients—unique circumstances that can’t be replicated at scale. The fourth
          cause is when the implementation of your idea has unintended consequences, or
          spillovers, that backfire against that same idea. And 18 the fifth is the
          “supply-side economics” of scaling—for instance, will your idea be too costly
          to sustain at scale? After you clear these BIG5 hurdles, you will know you have
          an idea that scales.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/E4AD7DAA-780D-428D-8B71-0C0E184E3D96)

          gains by adopting the practices necessary for maximum-impact scaling. It will
          unpack four proven techniques for increasing positive results at scale: using
          behavioral-economic incentives, such as the loss aversion principle, to create

          In the case of D.A.R.E., the National Institute of

          evidence “favoring the program’s preventative potential,”10and a subsequent
          study conducted soon after in Los Angeles among nearly as many students also
          concluded that D.A.R.E. led to a reduction in drug experimentation.11These 24
          purportedly strong results drove schools, police departments, and the federal
          government to just say yes to expanding D.A.R.E. nationwide, yet numerous
          scientific analyses over the following decade examining all of the known
          studies and data on the program yielded incontrovertible proof that D.A.R.E.
          didn’t actually have a meaningful impact. So what happened? The simple answer
          is this: It is not uncommon for data to “lie.” In the Honolulu study, for
          example, the researchers had calculated that there was a two percent chance
          their data would yield a false positive. Unfortunately, subsequent research

          The British psychologist Peter Wason’s classic Rule
          Discovery Test from the 1960s illustrates confirmation bias in action. He gave
          subjects three numbers and asked them to come up with the rule that applied to
          the selection of those numbers. Given the sequence of “2–4—6,”for example, they
          typically formed a hypothesis that the rule was even numbers. Then, the
          participants would present other sequences of even numbers, and researchers
          would tell them whether or not those numbers conformed to the rule. Through
          this process, participants were tasked with determining whether their
          hypothesis was correct. After several correct tries the 30 participants
          believed that they had discovered the rule. But in fact, they hadn’t, because
          the rule was much simpler: increasing numbers.]()[ >>](marginnote3app://note/8E751AAB-5A49-4D04-A098-139D7C554D4E)

A policy is proposed, voted on, and signed into law (or not), with little consideration given to the impact that policy will have—relative to the costs—when it is scaled up in the real world. Unfortunately, such oversights can come with grave real-world consequences, ranging from unequal outcomes whereby some populations reap more benefits of the policy than others, to massive cost overruns and budget shortfalls for which lawmakers must compensate by cutting other vital programs and services.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/70A752B2-7775-490F-9C78-D85562B8789C)

            - 为什么司机的收入没有提高？
            - At first, drivers were grateful. But their gratitude soon gave way to disappointment, as it turned out that while their total take per ride went up thanks to tipping, their overall wages didn’t. Why? When we crunched the data, we discovered that by instituting tipping on the platform we had created a problematic spillover: so many new drivers signed up with Uber after we implemented tipping that there were fewer rides—and thus fewer fares—to go around. On top of this, judging from customer ratings of drivers, tipping didn’t lead to higher quality service as we had anticipated. We weren’t sure exactly why this was the case, but it did fly in the face of years of hospitality management research. In other words, the advent of tipping incentivized more drivers to put in hours on the Uber platform, but it didn’t sufficiently incentivize them to up their game on customer service. But these surprises seemed insignificant compared to the big surprise that came next. When we looked at the data on how often passengers tipped—or didn’t tip—we found that only one percent of Uber passengers tipped on every trip they took.67That’s right, only one in every hundred people was sure to tip their driver! Meanwhile, 60 percent of people never tipped, and 39 percent sometimes did.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/3A142AF3-5956-4011-95F4-BCFC40F62470)为什么乘客不愿意付小费？

        - 什么是电压效应？
            - The Voltage Effect is about the science of scaling: why some ideas fail while others change the world, and how to give every idea its best chance at success. Success and failure are not about luck. There is a rhyme and reason to why some ideas fail and why some make it big. Certain ideas are predictably scalable, while others are predictably unscalable. You will undoubtedly find much fortune and create impact if you choose to scale those ideas that are predictably scalable.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/BAEAC1C5-2DB9-4627-BA78-C83B2A9B7BEA)
            - Voltage drops are what happens when that great electric charge of potential that drives people and organizations dissipates, leaving behind dashed hopes, not to mention squandered money, hard work, and time. And they are shockingly common. According to Straight Talk on Evidence, a venture created to monitor the validity of research across disciplines ranging from software development to medicine to education and beyond, between 50 to 90 percent of programs will lose voltage at scale.3[ >>](marginnote3app://note/541C49B9-9B07-4183-A99E-5D92F469342B)
        - 全书的内容结构：两部分。5大禁忌和4大方法
            - This book is broken into two parts. The first half will teach you that scaling is a fragile concept. It unpacks the BIG5, or the five key signature elements that will cause voltage drops and prevent an idea from taking off. The first is identifying false positives—these are cases where there was never any voltage in the first place, though it appeared otherwise. The second cause is overestimating how big of a slice of the pie your idea can capture. Often, this is the result of failing to know your audience—or assuming that the small subset of people who have bought into your idea are more representative of the general population than they actually are, so that when you expand your idea it falls short for a broader set of people. The third cause is failing to evaluate whether your initial success depends on unscalable ingredients—unique circumstances that can’t be replicated at scale. The fourth cause is when the implementation of your idea has unintended consequences, or spillovers, that backfire against that same idea. And 18 the fifth is the “supply-side economics” of scaling—for instance, will your idea be too costly to sustain at scale? After you clear these BIG5 hurdles, you will know you have an idea that scales.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/E4AD7DAA-780D-428D-8B71-0C0E184E3D96)
            - The second part of the book is about how to produce voltage gains by adopting the practices necessary for maximum-impact scaling. It will unpack four proven techniques for increasing positive results at scale: using behavioral-economic incentives, such as the loss aversion principle, to create rapid gains; exploiting easily missed opportunities on the margins of your operation; knowing when to quit in the short-term in order to win in the long-term; and designing a high-voltage culture that is sustainable at scale.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/D9E2B90C-4207-48F0-8FE3-DA2F457BC712)
            - 会失败的想法犯了哪5大禁忌：
                - Most of us think that scalable ideas have some “silver bullet” feature: some quality that bestows a “can’t miss” appeal. That kind of thinking is fundamentally wrong. There is no single quality that distinguishes ideas that have the potential to succeed at scale with those that don’t.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/0739A2C9-16CE-4D6F-90DF-159FC916E9F0)
                - But there are five specific traits that scalable ideas must process—the “key signatures” of ideas that scale, or what I call the BIG5[ >>](marginnote3app://note/C7E4CAA4-D65C-4A1C-9F98-A495AB969467)
                - But this book is not only about losses in voltage and how to avoid them as you scale. The voltage effect goes both ways, which is why I will also outline proven techniques for engineering voltage gains at scale—types of incentives, cultural features, and economic principles that will not only hold up at scale, but allow your impact to multiply[ >>](marginnote3app://note/A5A49946-D633-4682-B0FB-9465ACDC81BB)
        - Along the way, we will look closely at real-life stories that illustrate the lessons of the voltage effect. In the chapters ahead, you will gain a new perspective on how Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes managed to defraud investors and deceive the public, why celebrity chef/entrepreneur Jaime Oliver’s restaurant empire collapsed, and why a well-intentioned campaign to improve automotive safety backfired after it reached a critical mass.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/0EDDB72A-EDD2-4AC1-B3A7-B1D965E58FC4)

            - In order to replicate effectively you must conduct the same successful study/program/product test again with the same type of population, and ideally you must do so three or four times before you can be confident you have the truth. In some cases this might not be feasible, but my overarching point is that in those instances you should tread with caution rather than “move fast and break things.” Otherwise you will soon be broke yourself.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/06454333-AD68-409C-BE11-A2BA103DC648)

            - 在社会科学研究中，很多研究都无法通过重复验证in science, the practice of replication has become a hot-button issue, leading to what the media outlets are fond of calling the “replication crisis.” Since the 2010s, researchers have set out to replicate several high-profile experiments—especially in psychology—that made splashes in major newspapers and on television, and found that the results failed to replicate.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/E8474A85-501E-4E2C-A4CD-161613ACB7D0)
            - Unfortunately, false positives are ubiquitous across contexts; consider a 2005 study which found that between 94 and 99 percent of burglar-alarm calls turn out to be false alarms, and that false alarms make up between 10 and 20 percent of all calls to police.9[ >>](marginnote3app://note/BA15036E-DC3D-4075-BBA7-B041A5E4EFAE)

            - The employees who participated in the health initiative had no better outcomes than those who didn’t across all of the main outcome metrics important to Chrysler: absenteeism, presenteeism, healthcare costs, et cetera. Uh oh. It seemed the initial results were a statistical blip—a false positive. In other words, the initial data seemed to be lying.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/5386C0B5-AC4F-47E8-9239-AC92D265D50A)
            - In this case, it turned out that the employees who participated in the first pilot at Chrysler were not representative of all the employees at that plant, much less at all of the other plants. So while the early data did appear solid, clearly it did not tell the full truth.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/4F522911-F056-4529-8B7D-72D5806C53C9)
            - The fact that statistical errors—like false positives—can occur even in well-designed research studies can be unsettling, especially for those of us (myself included) who see science as a bastion of truth. Yet remember what Winston Churchill once said about democracy: It’s the worst form of government, except for all the others. Similarly, the scientific method is the “least worst” method we have for testing and refining important ideas.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/61ADF1B9-0716-4979-ABDF-E004E848EDCD)

For instance, when Lyft wants to test a new feature, they simply build it into the app and make it available to users, usually in just two or three markets to start. This gives my team ample data to analyze and determine if the new feature is worth scaling or not.
            - Shockingly—or perhaps not, considering what we have learned about false positives—only 39 of the 100 experiments produced the results reported in the published study[ >>](marginnote3app://note/373754F5-E90E-4852-8E8E-8A7411BC3DFC)

            - D.A.R.E. was an educational program built on a theory from psychology called social inoculation, which took the concept of vaccination from epidemiology—administering a small dose of an infectious disease to induce immunity—and applied it to human behavior.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/50245707-1D6E-430C-B7BE-9F7B73E0C58E)

            - It provided children with a great deal of information about drugs such as marijuana and alcohol, but failed to produce statistically significant reductions in drug use when these same kids were presented with opportunities to use them.

            - In the case of D.A.R.E., the National Institute of Justice’s 1985 assessment involving 1,777 children in Honolulu, Hawaii found evidence “favoring the program’s preventative potential,”10and a subsequent study conducted soon after in Los Angeles among nearly as many students also concluded that D.A.R.E. led to a reduction in drug experimentation.11These 24 purportedly strong results drove schools, police departments, and the federal government to just say yes to expanding D.A.R.E. nationwide, yet numerous scientific analyses over the following decade examining all of the known studies and data on the program yielded incontrovertible proof that D.A.R.E. didn’t actually have a meaningful impact. So what happened? The simple answer is this: It is not uncommon for data to “lie.” In the Honolulu study, for example, the researchers had calculated that there was a two percent chance their data would yield a false positive. Unfortunately, subsequent research shows that they underestimated that probability. There was never any voltage in D.A.R.E.12[ >>](marginnote3app://note/4D1D70D1-B04D-4A8D-9F79-30916A9FBE57)

            - Kahneman and Tversky’s landmark collaboration has since been chronicled in multiple books—for instance, Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, Dan Ariely’s Predictably Irrational, and Michael Lewis’ The Undoing Project—and some of the cognitive biases they studied have even found their way into the cultural lexicon. One of these is called confirmation bias, and it helps to explain why innocent yet avoidable false positives frequently occur.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/BAC596A6-07BF-43D5-99C8-F5E682832394)
            - By now I hope it’s clear that the most hazardous obstacle to successful scaling is not ignorance. It is the illusion of knowledge, arising either from misleading data, hidden biases, or outright deception.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/03838FC8-C3E0-41C6-BDEB-128DD164E11F)
            - The British psychologist Peter Wason’s classic Rule Discovery Test from the 1960s illustrates confirmation bias in action. He gave subjects three numbers and asked them to come up with the rule that applied to the selection of those numbers. Given the sequence of “2–4—6,”for example, they typically formed a hypothesis that the rule was even numbers. Then, the participants would present other sequences of even numbers, and researchers would tell them whether or not those numbers conformed to the rule. Through this process, participants were tasked with determining whether their hypothesis was correct. After several correct tries the 30 participants believed that they had discovered the rule. But in fact, they hadn’t, because the rule was much simpler: increasing numbers.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/8E751AAB-5A49-4D04-A098-139D7C554D4E)

            - Holmes was smart and charismatic, allowing her to win over investors, who then vouched for her to other investors, leading to a bandwagon effect. Moreover, thanks to confirmation bias, investors with a financial stake in the company likely overlooked signs that ran counter to their expectation that the company would be a massive success. And these weren’t people born yesterday. They included business titans like Rupert Murdoch, Carlos Slim, Larry Ellison, and others.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/C0E08E14-7C51-45AD-ACAA-4E5E70F42FAF)
            - The point here is that when bad ideas are endorsed by influential people and institutions, they can be contagious. And once a critical mass has climbed aboard that bandwagon, confirmation bias makes it much harder to convince people to change their now entrenched 33 beliefs. This is why it took many years, and many misspent millions, for D.A.R.E, to abandon its flawed approach.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/CA540E04-8597-477B-8E40-314A70F68FF6)
