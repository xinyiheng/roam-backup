- ### Highlights first synced by #Readwise [[December 16th, 2022]]
    - Welcome to the public beta of Reader! Walkthrough guides can be really boring so we've laced ours with spicy memes to keep those dopamine receptors firing while we subliminally demonstrate the basics of our software. We hope you don't mind a little fun. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmae5mjectw5frxgb5y4b554))
    - First, although we generally prefer our clean, distraction-free reading experience, there are some exceptions where the original site is more pleasing. In these cases, you can honor the OP and read as they intended. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmaed7eyzy53httxr21jeese))

    - That's right: you can finally highlight images! And those highlighted images, like all highlights in Reader, will be synced with and resurfaced in Readwise and/or your note-taking app of choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmgad1355zqq0snwqsey19gm))
    - **Double tap to highlight.** The mobile analog of using the keyboard shortcut `h` to highlight an entire paragraph is double tapping. If you're reading this on mobile, try double tapping this paragraph. It's awesome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmga5g27ajw540nvprn6cmq7))
    - YouTube highlighting ðŸŽ¥ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmga6sjzt90mmhzgqrrat48w))
    - Another feature that might seem out of place in a product called Reader, but is very much worth mentioning here is highlighting YouTube videos. Ultimately, Readwise is about betterment and YouTube has evolved into perhaps the best learning content platform in existence. Yet until now, there weren't many digital solutions to capture ideas and take notes while you watch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmga7hf4at0xte3ff7fma5vd))
