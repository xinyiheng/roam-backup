    - Margin notes
      
      In other reading apps, marginalia are stuffed into little icons or misaligned sidebars making it difficult to connect your notes to the author's prose. Inspired by [Tufte sidenotes](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and commenting in Google Docs and Notion, we designed annotations that will appear in the right margin, just like traditional marginalia, provided your screen has enough width.

    - Tiktok-like Feed UI
      
      Another novelty of the Reader Feed is a specialized, TikTok-inspired user interface enabling you to cruise through new items like a warm knife cutting through butter. You swipe up to advance, swipe down to reverse, save for later, and of course tap to just start reading. Advancing marks a document as seen, so this UI is a great way to clear your Feed. You can get through 100 to 200 items per day without breaking sweat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyf4z3z2n9t55yew54rnmh0))
