    - Generative AI exists because of the transformer
        - With beam search, the model is able to consider multiple routes and find the best option. While the text may seem plausible and coherent, it isn’t always factually correct.Because of this inherent predictive nature, LLMs can also fabricate information in a process that researchers call “hallucination”.
        - Its inventors discovered that transformer models could recognise and predict any repeating motifs or patterns.   
        - From pixels in an image, using tools such as Dall-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, to computer code using generators like GitHub CoPilot. It could even predict notes in music and DNA in proteins to help design drug molecules.
